## Part A — Threads, Kernel Mapping & Signals

**Screenshots**

![A1 — all workers + summary](partA_threads/images/a1_thread_run.png)
![A2 — signal_demo: commands + interaction (signal sent, cleanup msg, clean exit)](partA_threads/images/a2_signal_catch.png)
![A-curveball — 2 extra workers spawn after originals joined, then disappear](partA_threads/images/live_a.png)
**Written (one short answer)**

- **Why does a worker thread's joined result reach the main thread, but a forked
  child's value would not?**
  <threads share one address space (joined value read from shared memory); a forked
  child runs in a copied address space, so its changes never reach the parent>

**Anything not completed:** none

## Part B — Files, Permissions & Special Bits

**Screenshot**

![B1 — setuid / setgid / sticky bits + id output](partB_security/images/b1_special_bits.png)

**Written (one short answer)**

- **Translate your private file's final octal mode into the 9-char symbolic string**
  (e.g. `600` → `rw-------`).
  octal `600` → `rw-------`

**Anything not completed:** none

## Part C — Bash Scripting, PATH & Safe File Scanning

**Screenshot**

![C1 — collector run + consolidated report](partC_scripting/images/c1_collector_run.png)

**Written (one short answer)**

- **Why did `greeter` fail to run by name before you added your `bin` directory to
  PATH?**
  <the shell only searches directories listed in $PATH; adding ~/bin let it resolve the
  bare name `greeter`>

**Anything not completed:** none

## Part D — Concurrency, a Race Condition & File Locking

**Screenshot**
![D-curveball — per-buyer cap=8 enforced under concurrency](partD_secure/images/live_d.png)
![D2 — swarm lands at the correct stock after the lock](partD_secure/images/d2_patched.png)

**Written (one short answer)**

  - **Why did the unpatched `swarm` sometimes leave more stock than the correct final
  value (with `200` stock and `40` concurrent buyers)?**
  Concurrent buyers all read the same stale stock value before any of them wrote
  their decrement back, so most writes overwrote each other instead of stacking —
  a classic lost-update/TOCTOU race on the unsynchronized read-modify-write.
**Anything not completed:** none

## Part E — Backups, Archiving & cron Automation

**Screenshot**

![E1 — only RETAIN_N archives remain + log](partE_automation/images/e1_backup_retention.png)
![E-curveball — idempotent timed_job: 2nd run skipped via SEALTAG token](partE_automation/images/live_e.png)
**Written (one short answer)**

- **Archiving vs compression — which one actually shrank the bytes, and why?**
  <tar archives (bundles) many files into one; gzip/compression shrinks bytes —
  compression reduced the size>

**Anything not completed:** none
