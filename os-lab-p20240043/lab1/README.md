## Task 1: Operating System Identification

I ran `uname -a` and `lsb_release -a` to identify the OS. The system is running Ubuntu 24.04.4 LTS with kernel version 6.17.0-14-generic on a x86_64 architecture.

## Task 2: Essential Linux File and Directory Commands

I practiced creating directories with `mkdir`, creating files with `touch`, writing content with `echo`, copying with `cp`, renaming with `mv`, and deleting with `rm`. Each command was recorded into task2_file_commands.txt.

## Task 3: Package Management Using APT

`remove` uninstalls the program but keeps its configuration files (the `/etc/mc` folder still existed after remove). `purge` removes everything including configuration files (the `/etc/mc` folder was completely gone after purge).

## Task 4: Programs vs Processes (Single Process)

I ran `sleep 120 &` to start a background process, then used `ps` to confirm it appeared in the process list with its own PID, showing that a program becomes a process when executed.

## Task 5: Installing Real Applications & Observing Multitasking

I installed `htop` and `tmux`, then started multiple background tasks including two sleep processes and a Python HTTP server on port 8080. The `ps` output showed all processes running simultaneously, demonstrating OS multitasking.

## Task 6: Virtualization and Hypervisor Detection

Based on the output of `systemd-detect-virt` and `lscpu`, the system is running inside a virtual machine on VMware hypervisor, not on physical hardware.
